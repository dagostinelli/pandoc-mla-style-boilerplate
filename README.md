# pandoc-mla-style-boilerplate

I made this boilerplate to help me format my essays into MLA style from markdown.  There is a package called `texlive-mla-paper` that has an MLA style template in it for pandoc. But I found it to be a little problematic, so I copied it out into this.  That project was made by Ryan Aycock and you can find it here: https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mla-paper
