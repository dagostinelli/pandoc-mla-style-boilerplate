# pandoc-mla-style-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to help format essays into the MLA style from markdown.  The output is PDF files.

## How to use

1. Create essay and name it with a .md file extension
2. Edit the Makefile at the top and enter the file name
3. At command line, run `make`

 ## Credits
There is a package called `texlive-mla-paper` that has an MLA style template in it for pandoc. But I found it to be a little problematic, so I copied it out into this.  That project was made by Ryan Aycock and you can find it here: https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mla-paper
